 CTO Manifesto
-------------------
As IT professionals, we have experienced various obstacles against motivation and efficiency within technology producing organizations. We wish all CTO level professionals to be an advocate of the following:

* Don’t keep CTO out of top level decision making
* Do empower CTO in order to boost creativity
* Don’t expect CTO to own the products
* Do collaborate with CTO till the end
* Don’t consider CTO to be a super-hero
* Do trust CTO to build team-work
* Don’t come up to CTO with proposals
* Do give CTO a chance to figure out your needs

Once organizations are built on these values, IT would feel accountable and responsible from the overall output. We believe this will lead to unprecedented levels of synergy.
